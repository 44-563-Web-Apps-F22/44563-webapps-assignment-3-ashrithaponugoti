        <li>Pumbaa's real name is Pumbaa smith</li>
        <li>Pumbaa is actually the true brains of the outfit, having both common sense and impressive knowledge over things from nature to science</li>
        <li>Most animals are wary and dismissive of Pumbaa due to his pungent odor, but he remains happy-go-lucky by following a philosophy called Hakuna Matata.</li>
