    <h1>Ashritha Ponugoti</h1>
    <p>I have completed my udergraduation in the stream of Electrical and Electronics Engineering in the year of 2021.
        After my UG,I joined Accenture as Associate Software Engineer.Here my job role is specifically related to Application Development.
        During my work period I have realized that I need more expertise in programming languages and database.Hence I quit my job and decided to do masters in Computer Science.</p>
    <h2>Mahanati</h2>
    <p>This movie is a life story of great telugu actress "Savithri garu".I really liked the making of this movie 
        as the director Nag Ashwin tried to show each and every important aspect of her life.And the acting skills of 
        actress Keerthy Suresh are wonderful.I felt very mesmerized after watching the movie.
